For this assignment, I opted for Material-UI for the interface design because of its robust suite of ready-made components like side drawers and toggle buttons, which are incredibly handy and give the app a professional look with minimal effort.

## Why Material-UI?

Choosing Material-UI was straightforward. It offers everything needed to achieve a professional look quickly and comes with excellent documentation. This allowed me to focus more on building the app rather than getting bogged down with UI details.

## Managing User Feedback with React-toastify

To enhance user interaction, especially for error handling or empty search results, I integrated `react-toastify`. This tool is fantastic for displaying non-intrusive notifications that inform users effectively without disrupting their workflow. This means if a user's search yields no results, they immediately receive a friendly notification suggesting what to do next.

## Challenges Faced

Honestly, this project went off without a hitch. The combination of Material-UI and `react-toastify` provided all the necessary functionality, which made the development process smooth and trouble-free.

## Conclusion

Utilizing Material-UI and `react-toastify` significantly simplified the development process, saving time on frontend work and allowing me to deliver an app that not only looks good but also communicates clearly with the user. I'm very pleased with the outcome and feel this project is a great testament to choosing the right tools for an effective and enjoyable development experience.
